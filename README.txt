The purpose of this program is to provide local school's with a functional database which will allow administrators and users to store and reference CTE partners for usage.
We provide functionality to add new partners along with information, search for partners in the existing database, and ask our Chatbot questions regarding the partners and the program itself.


Please reference the source code provided when grading our submission
